# Project description
For my university course, I developed a Hotels project using MERN, RESTful API, Redux, and JWT auth. It is an MPA designed to manage data about hotels. Users can either be a hotel resident or a hotel owner. Hotel owners have admin rights to create hotels, set hotel services, and prices, view statistics (charts and data tables) for hotel payments. Hotel residents can search for hotels, see their services, pay for them, and view payment history. The project also offers dark/light mode, localization for English and Ukrainian.

# To download all depedencies go to client and server directory:
### `npm install`

# Also you need to create .env file, type in MongoDB collection link and random string for JWT.


# To run client:
### `npm start`

# To run server:
### `npm run devStart`
